        1. git checkout -b someonesCode main
        2. git checkout main
        3. git merge someonesCode
        4. git branch -d someonesCode

        Generally , when there is a conflict git stops the merging and presents the errors like this:
        <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< main
        conflicts from main branch
        =======
        conflicts from someonesCode branch
        >>>>>>> someonesCode branch.
        
        So , after resolving the conflicts like by rebasing making necessary changes. Some commands help us out here like , git log , git diff , git checkout, git reset.
