        1. git checkout -b someonesCode main
        2. git checkout main
        3. git merge someonesCode

        Generally , when there is a conflict git stops the merging and presents the errors like this:
        <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< main conflicts from main branch=======conflicts from someonesCode branch>>>>>>> someonesCode
            branch.

            So , after resolving the conflicts like by rebasing making necessary changes. Some commands help us out here
            like , git log , git diff , git checkout, git reset.

        1. Starting branch name with a category word e.g. Bugs.
        2. Using unique issue tracker IDs in branch names.
        3. Using hyphen in names.
        4. Using author name in Git branch.
        5. Avoid long names.

        1.RESTful API is an architectural style which uses http requests to access data and use.
        2. var http = require('http');
        http.createServer(function (req, res) {
        res.write("Hello World");
        res.end(); //end the response
        }).listen(8080);
        3. -> Write commits with correct conventions.
        -> Split bigger functions into smaller ones.
        -> Use of promises (JS)
        -> Use async/await (JS)

        1. The component will not work as it does not take name as a parameter or using props.
2. import React, { useState } from "react"
   const [name, setName] = useState("");

  
const myComponent = ({setName("Saud")} ) => (
  <div>Hi there! {name}</div>
);

3. this.state.message = 'Hello world'
This is wrong because state should not be manipulated outside the constructor , correct way is : constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      message: 'Hello world'
    };
  }

4. <button onclick={activateLasers}>
It is written correct.

5.  Use of turnery operator:
condition ? ("condition is true") : ("condition is false")

6. Key props is mostly used while mapping so we can identify each entity or object with its assigned key. It is commonly used in objects destructuring.

const Items = todos.map((todo) =>
  <li key={todo.id}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
);

7. Refs allow us to use and access react elements easily. 
Hooks are a feature of React JS they allows you to use state without writing a class component.

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
